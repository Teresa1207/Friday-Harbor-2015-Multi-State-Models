# Friday-Harbor-2015-Multi-State-Models

## Objective:  

To assess the risk of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) related neuropathology burden given current cognitive state, among older adults.

## Methods:  

Participants included 1,303 individuals enrolled in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and 1,789 individuals enrolled in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP); roughly 50% were deceased.  Using multi-state Cox proportional hazard models, we compared the cognitive status of all subjects alive at a given age and assigned future risk of dying with different AD related neuropathologies. Endpoints under consideration are Braak Stages (0-2,3-4,5-6), CERAD(0,1,2,3) and TDP (0,1,2,3).
